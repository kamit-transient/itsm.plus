## General

We're trying to keep it as simple as possible to contribute to our site.<br>
Here our 5 "golden" rules.

1. You need an active Github account
2. You should know how to use  `markdown`
3. You should know how to use `git`
4. Don't forget to create a credits section, even when you're using external assets
5. Be friendly, be respectful, don't be a dick!

## Content contributions

Why should you download all the overhead if you only want to create a new article? 
That's the reason why we have splitted our site and the content into two repositories.

1. Fork our site repository
2. Create a new entry and/or modify an existing entry
3. Ensure that everything is as expected 
4. Create a pull request with `develop` as target branch in our **content repository**

> We have an example file which helps you to getting started quickly.

## Site contributions

Why should you contribute to the site repository?

* You have found a bug and you want to fix them
* You have found a typo in our site
* We missed you in the credits list - sorry :(
* You want to make it better

Whatever the reason is - Thank you!

1. Fork our site repository
2. Make the world better
